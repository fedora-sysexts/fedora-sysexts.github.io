# systemd system extensions for Fedora image based systems

**NOTE: This project is a work in progress. Make sure to read the [known
limitations section](https://extensions.fcos.fr). Use at your own risk.**

This repo includes the sources for the main landing page and the configuration
for the Caddy redirector hosted at <extensions.fcos.fr>/

For sysexts built from Fedora packages only, see
[extensions.fcos.fr/fedora](https://extensions.fcos.fr/fedora).

For sysexts built from community sources, see
[extensions.fcos.fr/community](https://extensions.fcos.fr/community).

For general explainations about systemd system extensions (sysexts) and how
to use them, see the documentation from the main page:
[extensions.fcos.fr](https://extensions.fcos.fr).

## Building

Building those images currently require `root` privileges. The currently
supported options for building those sysexts are:
- using a rootless, privileged, non-SELinux confined container (such as a
  toolbox/distrobox container), redirecting `podman` commands to run them on
  the host:
  ```
  [toolbox]$ cat /usr/local/bin/podman
  #!/bin/bash
  executable="$(basename ${0})"
  exec flatpak-spawn --host "${executable}" "${@}"
  ```
- Using nested podman containers (current path in CI).

Make sure that you have the following packages installed:
- `cpio`
- `erofs-utils`
- `jq`
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
- `podman` (only when not using the host redirection script above)
- `wget`

To build the `python` sysext:

```
$ cd python
```

List the supported target images:

```
$ just targets
```

Build the sysext for Fedora CoreOS *next*:

```
$ just build "quay.io/fedora/fedora-coreos:next"
```

## `extensions.fcos.fr` redirector

A Caddy based redirector is hosted at `extensions.fcos.fr`. The configutation
is available in [Caddyfile](Caddyfile). It redirects URLs queried by
`systemd-sysupdate` to GitHub releases where the sysexts are hosted in this
repo.
